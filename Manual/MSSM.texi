This is an example for event generation in the MSSM using Sherpa's UFO
support. In the corresponding Example directory
@code{<prefix>/share/SHERPA-MC/Examples/UFO_MSSM/}, you will find a directory
@code{MSSM} that contains the UFO output for the MSSM
(@uref{https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/MSSM}). To run the example,
generate the model as described in @ref{UFO Model Interface} by
executing
@verbatim
cd <prefix>/share/SHERPA-MC/Examples/UFO_MSSM/
<prefix>/bin/Sherpa-generate-model MSSM
@end verbatim
An example run card will be written to the working directory. Use this
run card as a template to generate events.
