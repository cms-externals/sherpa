@chapter Getting help

If Sherpa exits abnormally, first check the Sherpa output 
for hints on the reason of program abort, and try to figure 
out what has gone wrong with the help of the Manual. Note 
that Sherpa throwing a ‘normal_exit’ exception does not 
imply any abnormal program termination! When using AMEGIC++
Sherpa will exit with the message:
@example
   New libraries created. Please compile.
@end example
In this case, follow the instructions given in
@ref{Running Sherpa with AMEGIC++}.

If this does not help, contact the Sherpa team (see the 
Sherpa Team section of the website 
@uref{http://sherpa.hepforge.org,,sherpa.hepforge.org}), providing 
all information on your setup. Please include
@enumerate
@item A complete tarred and gzipped set of the @option{.dat} 
files leading to the crash. Use the status recovery directory 
@code{Status__<date of crash>} produced before the program abort.
@item The command line (including possible parameters) you used to start Sherpa.
@item The installation log file, if available.
@end enumerate
